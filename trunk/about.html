<h1>Universal iPhone UI Kit v1.0</h1>

<ul class="data">
	<li><p>You're seeing an open source project to make universal interfaces for iPhone using technologies like HTML, CSS and all the capabilities of the phone.</p><p>This framework was made for that: make life easier for the developer, letting you run a few elements of HTML to build <strong>complex interfaces</strong> same as you'd see on the iPhone.</p><p>Look into the source code of this project, analyse each example and performs your own tests with a simple webserver and an iPhone Simulator or, a real iPhone. <strong>We're working</strong> to make more interfaces and add them to our framework <strong>for sharing with everyone</strong>.</p><p>Anyone can collaborate in the project, simply send me your edits to <a href="mailto:dlafuente@gmail.com">dlafuente@gmail.com</a> and then you add the SVN project.</p>
